		   <p>I was born in Memphis. This city has taught me a lot about the person I am today. I visit this city frequently. Most of my family, including my mother stays in Memphis, so it's a frequent stop of most of my vacations. Some of my favorite things to do while in Memphis are catching a Grizzlies games, if they're playing, visiting Beal street with my family a festival or get some delicious barbeque, or just hanging out downtown with my friends. There are lots of things to do in Memphis to keep yourself busy.</p>

		   <p>Detroit is my second home. My father and his side of my family stays in Detroit. It's always a good place to visit because it's not that far from school and most of my friends from high school and college are often there as well. In Detroit, I have a lot of fun just kicking at home with my pops or just visiting friends. My favorite stop when I'm visiting Detroit is Joe Dumars Fieldhouse. I spend a lot of time playing basketball there when I'm at home. Although my visiting period don't last long, I always have fun in Detroit.</p>

		 <section>
		   <p>Atlanta is my dream city. It's not as slow as most southern cities. It's the best of both worlds. Fast and upbeat like nothern cities and laid back but quiet like most southern cities. It reminds me of being back in Memphis and in Detroit, at the same time. I've visited this city probably 10 times in my life. After graduation, Atlanta will definitely be on my list of destinations. </p>

		   <p>I have visited Philadelphia multiple times because my older brother went to college at Lehigh University, which is an hour away. They have great food there and the city atomsphere during a Eagles game is crazy.</p>

		 <section>
		   <p>New York City is also a destination when visiting my brother at school. New York is really nice, too crowded in my opinion, but always a nice location for food and shopping. I would never be able to stay in NYC. I need space between me and my neighbors.</p>

		 <section>
		   <p>Miami. By far my favorite city of all-time. My 1st time visiting Miami was I was in middle school. My older brother and I were invited to a football camp at Miami University. Although we spent majority of our time at the camp, I got to see South Beach. Nothing will ever compare to SB. Although, I was too young to have any "real fun" I definitely enjoyed the weather and the atomsphere. My 2nd and 3rd time visiting Miami was during Spring Break. Miami will always be near the top of my vacation spots.</p>
