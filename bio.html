<h2>Something About Me</h2>
		<section>
		<img alt="" src="me.jpg">
			<p> My name is Philip Brandon Moore. I was born in Memphis, TN. My birthday is October 22nd. I moved to Detroit when I was 13 years old with my parents and my older brother. I graduated from Inkster high school in 2007. My first semester at Michigan State University was Fall 2007. During my time at Michigan State University, I have switched my major 3 to 4 times. </p>

			<p> My focus was always to deal with computers but I never really knew exactly what I wanted to do with computers. When I was accepted into Michigan State University, my 1st major was Business. Not exactly sure why it was Business. My next major was Computer Science and Engineering. After learning what I could do with the Computer Science and Engineering degree, I looked for a different major. After a lot of career searching in comparsion with degrees, I chose Media and Information with a minor in Information Technology.</p>
		</section>
		<aside>
			<p>I chose Media and Information as my major for a few reasons. I did not have to deal with my two worst subjects, Chemistry and Physics, and I did not have to deal with taking a bunch of Math courses while still learning a lot about computers. Media and Information has taught me a lot about how people use social media and other types of technology, while my minor in Information Technology has allowed me to learn my about computer's hardware. Giving me the best of both worlds.</p>
			<p>I currently work at MSU's Computer Help and Repair doing IT Consulting work. My official title is an IT Consultant. We deal with a wide range of computer problems, from viruses to software installation. Our help is available to Students, Faculty, Staff or anyone associated with someone that is affilated with the University. </p>
			<p>At my current job, I have transitioned from working downstairs, doing mainly software troubleshooting and consultants to upstairs where we do hardware repairs.</p>
			<p>Since working in that department, I have done many different hardware replacements. Ranging from swapping out Hard Drives to completely taking apart a computer and diagnosing what the problem is and putting the computer back together. I never knew how much fun taking a computer apart could be.</p>
			<p>Working at the Computer Help and Repair has really opened my eyes to what career path I would like to travel down. After graduation, I am looking to get into IT Help Desk. </p>
